## Html5 Wolfenstein 3D Game Demo

A **JavaScript** and **HTML5** game demo where I use some of the sprites from the original Wolfenstein 3D game.

## Features:

- Enemy AI (Pathfinding)
- Sound Effects and Music
- Items

## Maps

The maps were built using a Map Editor called **Tiled** for easier manipulation: https://www.mapeditor.org.

The map files are located in the project folder: _/assets/maps_

- D - Rotate to the right
- W - Move Forward
- S - Move Backward
